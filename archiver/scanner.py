"""
Archive directories that haven't been modified to object storage.

When users have not logged into their JupyterHub session for a long time,
we want to move their home directories to object storage to save cost.
This script can be run periodically to find such users, and archive their
home directories to object storage.

WHen run, this script will:

1. Scan all user home directories (assumed to be subdirectories of the root provided
   to the script) for *staleness*. A user home directory is considered stale if there
   is not a single regular file (we do not currently count directories) that has been
   created or modified since the cutoff date we give it. We also pass a list of file
   names that are ignored when testing for staleness - this is primarily so that the
   file we drop with instructions on how to retrieve your files doesn't mark the whole
   home directory at unstale. At the end of this step, we have a list of user home
   directories that are ready to be archived.
2. Use `tar` to make a compressed archive of the stale home directory, and upload it
   to object storage *if necessary*. So the script can be run multiple times, and it
   will not do unnecessary uploads.
3. If the --delete flag is passed, drop a note telling users where they can get their
   files back from, and then *delete their files*. This is a destructive action!

The idea is that you can run this script once to do all the uploads, and run it
again with --delete to validate your uploads *and* delete existing home directories.

    This somewhat ugly design lets us walk the file tree just once, and skip large

    filenames in ignored_filenames will be ignored when testing the recentness

    Directory mtimes are ignored, primarily so that us putting in `notice` files about
    where to find your archived directories does not mark a directory as 'active'. New
    directory creations or file deletions in a directory will also no longer mark
    a directory as active - a new file must be created or modified. This seems
